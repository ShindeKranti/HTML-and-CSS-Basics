    <h2>My Introducion</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Kranti Shinde. I am a final year B.Tech student in Information Technology at MGM College of
         Engineering, Nanded. My technical skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Python.
          I have successfully applied these skills in various projects such as Job Saathi, ERP Management System, 
          and College Grievance System, among others. I also have good leadership abilities, which I have demonstrated 
          in various group projects and activities. I was selected, along with my team, for the Galgotias International
           Hackathon in the web development category. I have a strong understanding of tools like Jupyter Notebook,
            MySQL Workbench, and VS Code. I am focused on continuously learning new technologies. Thank you.</p>
